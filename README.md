A decompilation of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader: Make the Grade (PS2)

This is a project that aims to completly decomple the aforementioned PS2 game. This is still in the very early stages and I'm doing this on my own at the moment for fun, so for now I'm just using this to put everything in one place.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please contact me. Contact info can be found on my website: https://gmon20.github.io/
